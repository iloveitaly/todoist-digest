# Todoist Project Digest

[Todoist](https://mikebian.co/todoist) doesn't have a way to generate a digest of all recent comments in a project created by a specific user. This makes it challenging to see what changed and what requires your action if you are collaborating with someone on a project.

This is a simple project which generates a digest of all comments by a particular user on a particular project.

This project was also a good excuse to play around and test some functional programming/data manipulation tooling I've been messing with ([funcy](https://github.com/Suor/funcy), [funcy-pipe](https://github.com/iloveitaly/funcy-pipe), and [whatever](https://github.com/Suor/whatever)).

## Usage

### Docker

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/iloveitaly/todoist-digest:latest
docker run --env-file .env ghcr.io/iloveitaly/todoist-digest:latest
```

Want to run a one off execution?

```shell
docker run --env-file .env ghcr.io/iloveitaly/todoist-digest:latest todoist-digest --help
```

Want to inspect the docker container?

```shell
docker run -it ghcr.io/iloveitaly/todoist-digest:latest bash
```

### Locally


Run this locally using:

```shell
bin/local-digest-html
```

Or run directly:

```shell
poetry run todoist-digest \
  --last-synced "2023-12-04T15:52:48Z" \
  --target-user user@gmail.com \
  --target-project ProjectName
```

Or, email yourself the digest:

```shell
poetry run todoist-digest \
  --last-synced $LAST_SYNC \
  --target-user $TARGET_USER \
  --target-project $TARGET_PROJECT \
  --email-auth $EMAIL_AUTH \
  --email-to $EMAIL_TO
```

## Development

### Docker Build

This repo uses [nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs/getting-started) for building a Dockerfile. Why? Because I like trying new things.

Until [asdf support](https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks/pull/1026) is built into nixpacks, you'll have to do something like:

```shell
export NIXPACKS_POETRY_VERSION=$(asdf-current-version poetry)
export NIXPACKS_PYTHON_VERSION=$(asdf-current-version python)
```

(asdf-current-version is a function [I have in my shell](https://github.com/iloveitaly/dotfiles/blob/d597a90cd84fb4c5c47efa78255e45a537f1155c/.functions#L17-L21) which returns the current version of a tool)

In order to pass the py + poetry versions properly to nixpacks:

```shell
nixpacks build . --name todoist-digest --env NIXPACKS_PYTHON_VERSION --env NIXPACKS_POETRY_VERSION --start-cmd bin/cron-digest
```

### Run with ipdb

Open up an exception when there's an exception:

```shell
ipdb3 $(which todoist-digest) --last-synced 2023-12-14T13:38:25Z ...
```
