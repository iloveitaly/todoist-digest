# Todoist Project Digest

[Todoist](https://mikebian.co/todoist) doesn't have a way to send a digest of all recent comments on a project by a specific user. This makes it more challenging to easily see what changed and what requires your action if you are collaborating with someone on the project.

This is a simple project which generates a digest of all comments by a particular user on a particular project.

## Usage

TODO

# TODO

- [ ] hook into <https://github.com/iloveitaly/iloveitaly/blob/main/.github/workflows/follower-notifier.yml>
